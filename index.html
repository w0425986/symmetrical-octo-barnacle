<H1>Chickpea Tuna Salad</H1>
<h2>This is one of my favorite recipes I make every week. It's high in protein and great for meal prepping because it keeps in the fridge for 3-4 days.</h2>
<ul>Ingredients</ul>
<li>1 14 oz can no sodium-added chickpeas, drained and rinsed</li>
<li>1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise, or 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp mashed avocado</li>
<li>1 tbsp smooth Dijon mustard, or whole grain mustard</li>
<li>1 1/2 tbsp ume plum vinegar or red wine vinegar</li>
<li>1 celery rib, chopped</li>
<li>2 tbsp minced green onion</li>
<li>1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1/4 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
<li>4 leaves romaine lettuce</li>
<li>2 sheets of roasted seaweed or nori, cut into small strips</li>
<li>4 pieces of toast</li>
<br>
  <ol>Instructions</ol>
    <li>Place the chickpeas, vegan mayonnaise, avocado (if using), Dijon mustard, vinegar of choice, minced celery, minced onion, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into a food processor</li>
    <li>Pulse a few times until everything is minced and incorporated. Be careful not to overblend. You shouldn't be pulsing it for more than 20 seconds and don't want to puree the salad.</li>
    <li>Line pieces of freshly toasted bread with romaine. Top with the chickpea tuna salad, and enjoy!</li>
